"""Given an array of pairs of values representing edges in an unweighted graph, create the equivalent adjacency list/set representation (a map from element to a list or set of elements). Pairs represent directed edges: (A, B) means there is an edge from A to B. If the pair (B, A) is also provided then there is an undirected edge between A and B. For simplicity, you may assume that each node of the graph stores an integer rather than a generic data type and that the elements are distinct. Implement a basic DFS and BFS searching for a target value and a topological sort (using either DFS or Kahnâ€™s algorithm).
