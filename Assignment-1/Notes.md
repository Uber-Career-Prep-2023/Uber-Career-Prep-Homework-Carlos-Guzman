"""As a reminder, the options are:

**** Two Pointer Techniques: *****

1) Fixed-size sliding window
2) Variable-size (shrinking/ growing) sliding window
3) Reset/catch-up two-pointer
4) Forward/backward two-pointer
5) Two arrays/strings two-pointer

**** Sorting & Searching Techniques: ****

1) Binary search variation
2) Sorting algorithm variation
3) Sort the array, then solve

**** Hashing Techniques *****

1) One-directional running computation/total
2) Bi-drectional running computation/total
3) Hash the elements
4) Two arrays/strings increment/decrement hashmap counts
